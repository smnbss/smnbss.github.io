<p>As you might already know, I work for JustEat, we are a start-up, a very big one, but still a start-up, I work on the Technology Department, I’m a team leader (I try to do my best at being one) and we have many many <a class="vt-p" href="http://bit.ly/ZGe1mN">open positions</a>.</p>
<p>Recently we had a few good developers coming in for an interview, and they all seem quite surprised that we do not adhere to any specific agile methodology.</p>
<p>We do not do <a class="vt-p" href="http://vimeo.com/58130642#" target="_blank">SCRUM, we do not do KANBAN</a>, we do not do regular stand-up.<br />
We believe we are better than that. We are <strong>Agile to the extreme</strong>.</p>
<p>We use a mix of those methodologies, we use <a class="vt-p" href="https://justeat.hipchat.com/home" target="_blank">HipChat</a>  and public rooms for all our conversations so that everyone can just jump into another team room, ask question or just keep an eye on what people are doing, we use <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank">JIRA</a> to keep our workflow public within our company, everyone can go and have a look at each team board, and see what they are working on and what it’s coming up next in their list. <a class="vt-p" href="http://smnbss.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image.png"><img style="margin-left:0;display:inline;margin-right:0;border:0;" title="image" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image_thumb.png" width="277" height="117" border="0" /></a><a class="vt-p" href="http://smnbss.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image1.png"><img style="margin-left:0;display:inline;margin-right:0;border:0;" title="image" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image_thumb1.png" width="225" height="120" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We also have a weekly report  that goes out every week to everyone and explain what the Tech department has been working on.</p>
<p>We love technology, we live with technology and use a lot of different technologies, we use a <strong>Microsoft </strong>stack (MVC/.NET/C#/SQL Server) on <strong>Amazon AWS</strong>, we use <strong>Java and DynamoDB </strong>for our Search Engine and <strong>Hadoop </strong>processing, we use <strong>Ruby </strong>for test and automation, we use <strong>Powershell </strong>for some throw away scripting, we use <strong>Coffeescript/CouchDB</strong> for our EPOS system, we use a ton of open source frameworks.</p>
<p>But, (there is always a but) we are also very business oriented, we do not use all those different technologies just because we like them, we do so because we believe that it’s always better to use the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about our iper agile way of working, do not hesitate to reply to this post.</p>
