<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Test Better - <a class="vt-p" title="http://bit.ly/10OgfmP" href="http://bit.ly/10OgfmP">http://bit.ly/10OgfmP</a><br />
Phil Haack last week posted about testing, and the way it’s part of each modern developer’s life to write unit testing, and to help QA the software we are writing.</p>
<p>The way I see it, he’s completely right, I’m demanding more attention to unit and functional testing from me and the members of my team. It’s good to have dedicated QA resources that help a team of developers to keep high the attention toward quality, that help to coordinate the testing of new functionality being released by all the members of a team.</p>
<p>I like to get dedicated QA members involved early on in the process of analyzing new features, help figure out the weakness of the business requirements, and ultimately *help* developers test their code.</p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>TeamCity plugin for Visual Studio - <a class="vt-p" title="http://bit.ly/10Ohz9c" href="http://bit.ly/10Ohz9c">http://bit.ly/10Ohz9c</a><br />
This is a tool that has existed for a long time and yesterday Maarten Balliauw blogged about it in the JetBrains blog.</p>
<p>It’s a super useful tool you can use to run build and automation testing on a Team city server rather than your local machine without having to commit to a source control first. neat!</p>
