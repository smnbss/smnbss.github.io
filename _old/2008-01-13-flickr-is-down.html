<h4><em>"</em><a class="vt-p" href="http://blog.flickr.com/en/2008/01/12/downtime-notice/"><em>Downtime notice</em></a><b><br />
<em>UPDATE 1</em></b><br />
<em><b>4:13pm PST:</b> Anyone who’s ever worked in software probably knows that time estimates are tricky. Given that we’d prefer that Flickr be as close to 100% stable as we can make it before we go back online, we’re going to take more time to make sure that’s what happens.</em></h4>
<p><em><b>The latest estimate from our awesome Ops team is 6:30pm PST</b>. </em></p>
<p><em>It’s better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your precious photos, plus, there’s the added benefit of giving us all a chance to reflect on our serious Flickr addictions. Thank you again for your patience.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<hr />
<p><em><b>2:30pm PST:</b> We started on a database upgrade and a few alters to the database structure last night. Given our scale, work like this takes a long time, and makes a definite impact on site performance.</em></p>
<p><em>You may have noticed today that the site is having lots of hiccups and that behaviour is generally pretty erratic. So, we’ve decided to take the site offline help things settle down. <b>We’re anticipating a couple of hours</b> is all we need at this point, so, we’re hoping to be back online around 4:30 PST.</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry about this! It will be one of those massages that ‘hurts so good’ and we’ll post updates here as we have them. "</em></p>
<p>Guys,<br />
Good luck with the new version of the site.<br />
I'm going to upgrade my site tomorrow, hope to have better luck!</p>
