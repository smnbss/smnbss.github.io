<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!1298" class="bvMsg">
<p>IE6 B2 is not that bad but css layout is broken more or less in all the sites and it's quite unstable.</p>
<p>I understand they're updating the way IE render the sites, but even the IE7 emulation mode is crappy.</p>
<p>How can a software that should be better than his previous version, be worst than it's previous version???</p>
<p>At least FF3 B1 is as stable as FF2...</p>
</div>
