<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!1385" class="bvMsg">
<p>As this blog point out</p>
<p><a class="vt-p" title="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/11/more-space-for-youtube-videos.html" href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/11/more-space-for-youtube-videos.html">http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/11/more-space-for-youtube-videos.html</a></p>
<p>YouTube started to adopt a new video resolution. They moved from the old standard 4:3 to the new more common 19:9.</p>
<p>I like the new resolution but I'm curious to know what's the impact in terms of bandwidth for google to switch from the old to the new format.</p>
<p>All the news video seems to be in the new format. I don't think people is uploading only videos in the new format so I guess google is cropping the new videos like some TV does, while for the old one they'reÂ  showing 2 black stripes on the left and right of the video.</p>
<p>One more thing I discovered it that YouTube use his own CDN : ytimg.com to serve video thimbnails</p>
