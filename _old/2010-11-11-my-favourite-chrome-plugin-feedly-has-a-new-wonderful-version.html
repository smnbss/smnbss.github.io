<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a> for a long time. It’s a smart plugin that connects to Google Reader and presents your blogs in a magazine-like page.</p>
<p>It’s super cool because it presents you with nice images, that helps you screening what you want to read.</p>
<p>Another of my favourite plugins was <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/kbmipnjdeifmobkhgogdnomkihhgojep">Shareaholic</a>, but I’ve been having some problems recently sharing stuff on Facebook because of the popup blocker in Chrome.</p>
<p>Now finally Feedly took over Shareholic and started to offer a sharing service via Feedly Mini.</p>
<p>You can read more on the official blog: <a title="http://blog.feedly.com/2010/11/08/feedly-mini-redesigned/" href="http://blog.feedly.com/2010/11/08/feedly-mini-redesigned/">http://blog.feedly.com/2010/11/08/feedly-mini-redesigned/</a></p>
