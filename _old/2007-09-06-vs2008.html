<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!1159" class="bvMsg">
<p>Today is the day!!! :D<br />I've just installed VS2008 and I'm trying to use it to build and modify my .net 2.0 project.<br />My project is composed by 2 web sites and 14 class library, so, the first time I opened the project using Visual Studio 2008, it run the upgrade wizard. I was a bit scared about that, but in the end it seems to modify only the *.csproj files adding those elements on the PropertyGroup Element :<br />&lt;FileUpgradeFlags&gt;<br />&lt;/FileUpgradeFlags&gt;<br />&lt;OldToolsVersion&gt;3.5&lt;/OldToolsVersion&gt;<br />&lt;UpgradeBackupLocation&gt;<br />&lt;/UpgradeBackupLocation&gt; </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the first conversion I did OldToolsVersion was 2.0, but... I'll go deep into this.</p>
<p>For now, after the first day of use it seems to be a stable IDE.</p>
