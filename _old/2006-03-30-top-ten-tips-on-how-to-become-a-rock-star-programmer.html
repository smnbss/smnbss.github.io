<h2><span style="font-size:xx-small;">#6 Read books </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:xx-small;">You might be good at what you do, but knowing only that, whatever it may be, is seldom enough to really shine. Knowing enough about more fields than the field you are about to shine in is golden. Take for instance a GUI coder that knows nothing about databases. He might be almost useless since he can't interact with the guy doing the backing store, and so on. It takes as much effort to be 90% good in five fields than to be 99% good one one. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:xx-small;">#7 Go back and enhance your old code </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:xx-small;">Not that it is sound from an economical point of view but because you learn oodles of things reading you own crap, which old code always is. Code gets rotten after a couple of years, it really does, since you evolve. If you can't find bad things in your old code you either already are a rock star programmer, or maybe more probable, hasn't evolved much lately. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:xx-small;">#8 Eat your own dog food! </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:xx-small;">If you create APIs, create some applications using that API. If you create applications, ask your friends/wife(s)/husband(s)/children to try it. Don't say <em>you </em>did it; say that your crappy no-good overpaid work mate did it, so you get some honest feedback. Honest feedback is golden. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:xx-small;">#9 Don't ask people for advice </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:xx-small;">Learn how to get that answer yourself instead,  <span style="font-size:xx-small;">[...]</span></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:xx-small;"> <span style="font-size:xx-small;">[...]</span></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-size:xx-small;">#11 And last... </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:xx-small;">Eat right, exercise more, don't drink too much coffee, and all that other crap that matter more than you think, but you won't do because I said so. </span></p>
