<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!1805" class="bvMsg">
<p>One of the biggest problem with ajax is that google has a lot of problem crawling your website.<br />
The biggest problems is with paginated lists. There are many ways to solve the problem.</p>
<p>in the .NEt world everything is already there, waiting for you to find and use it</p>
<p>&lt;asp:DataPager has a very useful parameter called QueryStringField.<br />
If you specify that field, the control is rendered as a list of hyperlink instead of a postback control.</p>
<p>With some server side code you can set that parameter only if the user agent is a crawler, or you can add more complex logics behind it.</p>
<p>This simple change on your website will allow google to crawl a lot more pages on your website and increase the organic traffic on your site</p>
