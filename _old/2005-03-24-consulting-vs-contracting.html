<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!155" class="bvMsg">
<p>Interesting considerations about Consulting vs. Contracting JobStyle <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sirenian/9520.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/sirenian/9520.html</a>Â Is quite right, exept &quot;If you don't know about a certain type of architecture you can ask which book you should read. If you want to do a project on the side there are people around to help you, with no one fearing that it might detract from your day job.&quot; If ur society don't buy the books u need, ur colleagues don't know nothing, and u don't have the possibilities to grow up in interesting projects... Consulting role is not so good...</p>
