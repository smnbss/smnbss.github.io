<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!1259" class="bvMsg">
<p>I had to fly back to Italy last Friday to work with some friends of mine on a new project.<br />They're creating a start up in Italy called <a href="http://aqrate.it/">Aqrate</a>.<br />In Uk i'me getting involved on a new start up too, called <a href="http://www.xenialmedia.com/Contact.html">Xenial</a>, I'm trying to involve them on a new project, not because they're my friends but because they're great and hopefully the collaboration will have a great result.</p>
