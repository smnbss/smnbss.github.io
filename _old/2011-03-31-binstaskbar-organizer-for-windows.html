<p>I’ve just installed Bins (<a title="http://bit.ly/erEuNa" href="http://bit.ly/erEuNa">http://bit.ly/erEuNa</a>) and it has already changed the way I work.</p>
<p>My taskbar was a huge mess before, I had 60/70 icons and I had to use small icons in 2 lines to use as less screen as possible, but it was becoming quite hard to manage</p>
<p>This is my new taskbar with Bin installed:<a href="http://smnbss.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/image8.png">     <br /><img style="background-image:none;border-bottom:0;border-left:0;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;border-top:0;border-right:0;padding-top:0;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image_thumb6.png" width="450" height="52" /></a></p>
<p>With Bin installed, I can group icons the way I want (work tools, social tools, media tools) and use only about 20 icons on my taskbar but still keeping all the tools I need just one click away.</p>
<p>I really hope Microsoft will buy this product and make it a default on Windows 8 <img style="border-style:none;" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/wlemoticon-smile.png" /></p>
<p>I love this product!</p>
