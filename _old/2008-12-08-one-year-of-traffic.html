<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!1384" class="bvMsg">
<p>This is just an observation after one year we run gurgle.com (in fact it has been running for about 1.5 years but I want to analyse just the 2008)</p>
<p>The first of July the site went through a split to .com (US market), .co.uk (UK market) and .in (Indian market).</p>
<p>The Indian numbers are irrelevant at the moment</p>
<p>This graph represent the .com site</p>
<p><a class="vt-p" href="http://ydyfhw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pQiADyZ-oCFqed62dgasDUPsS9jG8wRZ7Br5aHy1f36vhUlx4yN3ezuIHe05KBqSTJ0ZBdQgRovw?PARTNER=WRITER"><img style="border:0;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/y1pYAu-pSsJ6g3ySaqHhiu3e9FhyYef7OS_dDZdjJZ0NzICUBCG9BvjMGfY2fMohemJoLKAHPOTcMo?PARTNER=WRITER" border="0" alt="image" width="743" height="504" /></a></p>
<p>while this represent the .co.uk</p>
<p><a class="vt-p" href="http://ydyfhw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pZEY_TnpBQ5ZivySl0KhKBOYK7kALXUvAZESisRB84pqZ4pCC_MCyF6-fG92SIqiJvMsf5Ocpldr4eKQlO0_H0A?PARTNER=WRITER"><img style="border:0;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/y1peTPQ5kGssXKTXmLmI2_Icnhyb3V34eVpbzzHZu8380BebmLmueTm8gOkr2LFkcsC0XFGiOMI0WtFGyUbwY14nw?PARTNER=WRITER" border="0" alt="image" width="746" height="506" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see the numbers on .com are going down after the slit and the Bounce rate is growing a little bit and it worry me, while numbers on .co.uk are generally growing but average time on site is going down, pages/visit and new visits are going down.</p>
<p>In some fields we're doing much better than the average in the sector so this is still a positive situation to handle, but may be is time to do something new to keep users on the site and may be time to launch a new campaign to invite new mums to use the site.</p>
<p>One thing very hard to do is to aggregate data to see the average trend of the site, .com and .co.uk all together.</p>
<p>May be this is something google analytics should allows us to do.</p>
<p>Anyway 21'948'745 + 8'189'393 = 30'138'138, 30M of pages served in one year is a pretty huge number I think...</p>
