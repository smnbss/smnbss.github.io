<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!858" class="bvMsg">
<div>I spent my last Week End in Canterbury to meet my friend Elena, and i meet her housemate (only someone).</div>
<div>We went to see the eclipse of the moon then to a Party. </div>
<div>The moon was nice, but the ring tones of Xristina phone was better i think (Stylophonic - Dancefloor but in another version):)</div>
<div>I had a lot of fun!!!!</div>
<div>I've only few pics <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/38638371@N00/">http://flickr.com/photos/38638371@N00/</a></div>
