<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!1752" class="bvMsg">
<p>I saw this few days ago</p>
<p><em>Peer-to-peer content distribution companies like Vuze, BitTorrent, and Pando raised millions of dollars over the last several years under the assumption that big media companies would shift some of their distribution to P2P to cut their bandwidth costs. But that hasn't happened, and now many P2P companies are looking for new business models.</em></p>
<p><em>For </em><a class="vt-p" href="http://www.vuze.com/app"><em>Vuze<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/t.gif" alt="" /></em></a><em>, which has raised $32 million in financing, that now includes distributing hi-def porn via BitTorrent. For $25 a month, you can download "unlimited" adult video in HD from Vuze's "StudioHD" lineup, </em><a class="vt-p" href="http://newteevee.com/2009/05/15/vuze-looks-for-money-in-porn/"><em>NewTeeVee reports<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/t.gif" alt="" /></em></a><em>. The company is also trying to launch "sports, music and other premium channels."</em></p>
<p><em>from </em><a class="vt-p" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/p2p-startup-looks-to-porn-for-profits-2009-5">http://www.businessinsider.com/p2p-startup-looks-to-porn-for-profits-2009-5</a></p>
<p>And browsing the web I discovered this p2p flash player: <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.play2p.com/">http://www.play2p.com/</a><br />
It looks very promising, it promise HD videos with very little bandwidth usage (it says “will not eat up any additional bandwidth” :))<br />
Apparently the domain share the name server with<br />
porncake.com<br />
pornkolt.com<br />
pornocake.com<br />
pornstarsmachine.com</p>
<p><em>from </em><a class="vt-p" href="http://www.robtex.com/dns/play2p.com.html">http://www.robtex.com/dns/play2p.com.html</a></p>
<p>I don’t know if this has something to do with some new adobe functionality introduced with flash player 10</p>
<p>RTMFP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing NetStream.BufferTime on the subscriber side of P2P connection, causes video to stop and possible crash</li>
<li>No NetStream onStatus messages received when using NetStream.pause(), NetStream.resume() or NetStream.togglePause() for P2P connection</li>
<li>Intermittent crashes/hangs when subscribing/unsubscribing multiple times to P2P NetStream.</li>
<li>peerStreams array includes null streams in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>but it looks like the Porn industry is making the web a better place once again :)</p>
