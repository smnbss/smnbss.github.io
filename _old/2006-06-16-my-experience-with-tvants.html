<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!400" class="bvMsg">
<div>In Italy, our public television bought only few matches of the mundial 2006 in Germany.</div>
<div>Luckly i discovered TvAnts, so i can see (only see because of language) all the matches in a chinese tv CCTV5.</div>
<div>This is fanthastic!! I must stay at home 2 months due to the operation to my leg i had the 13 giune, and i don't have sky, so this is the only way i've to see some matches! :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll soon let you see my leg <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smile_tongue.gif" /></div>
