<div id="msgcns!A117AA5E007A0648!261" class="bvMsg">
<p>I agree with he so much, expecially when he talk about smart client.</p>
<p>I don't understand very wel why Microsoft had created the idea of a Smart Client and then do a step behind reintroducing a new born old technology like AJAX.</p>
<p>Everyway, I think that everything have  a scope and in some cases we'll have no choice and we'll have to use AJAX, ATLAS is well come :)</p>
