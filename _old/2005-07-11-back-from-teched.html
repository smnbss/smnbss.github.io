<div>I saw a lot of interesting things as <a href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/robert/archive/2005/05/25/14114.aspx">II7</a>, preview of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/commerceserver/2006preview/default.mspx">CommerceServer2006</a>, some sessions about SQL2005, Indigo, and a boring sessions about themes and customization of asp.net 2.0...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As the fist time at TechEd i changed my way of select sessions to follow at least twice time...</div>
<div>In conclusion, i've followed some sessions that was not too interesting, while i've loosed other one that may be better for me... I hope to get </div>
