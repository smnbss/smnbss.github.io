<p>Thursday I received a very sad email from Bookarmy: the website is being closed…</p>
<p>I’ve spent 2 intense years of my life building the site, and the community, with a fantastic Team of people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I had to leave the team, because of some major disagreement with the new management that came in to turn the project around, that did not happened and I had a strong feeling that they had no idea about what they where trying to do, so I abandoned the ship a year ago.</p>
<p>Now I’m happily working as Technical Product Lead for TDPG, where we are building a set of business intelligence product for Estate Agents. It’s a complex and fascinating job, and a great team of people.</p>
<p>Going back to Bookarmy, I have received a plea from a BA user to keep the site open. I was so touched by the love some of our users have for us that I have decided to publish the plea, even if no one can really do anything to keep it open.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:xx-small;">“Dear Simone,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:xx-small;"> I wish first of all, to thank you for your help with my bookarmy account problems.<br />
Secondly, please read my plea below and pass it on to the rest of the bookarmy team.<br />
</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:xx-small;">”Dear EVERYBODY on the Bookarmy.com team,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:xx-small;"> I absolutely LOVE this site, it has held the only sense of community I have felt in a long 6 years in my current locale. I have found everyone here on Bookarmy friendly, helpful, quirky, and fun-loving.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:xx-small;">I would HATE for Bookarmy to go down without a fight from its members.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:xx-small;">If we made this at least temporarily a low-pay membership site, until the economic climate changes, and brought to bear new marketing techniques to drum up new advertising, we could have our Bookarmy and read it, too!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:xx-small;">I think there are enough adult members who would not miss $2-$3 (or 1-2 pounds, as the case may be) per month to keep this grand experiment in truely genuine social networking going long enough to ride out the economic downturn!!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:xx-small;">PLEASE consider keeping Bookarmy going under these terms, and spread the option to all members(if  enough adults pay to keep the site going ((even voluntarily)) the younger members could even stay on for free).</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:xx-small;">If you can set up a secure site, I will start the donations off with $5 (and I'm out of work).   If I can do a small membership fee thus, so can most of the other members!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:xx-small;">Sincerely,”</span></em></p>
<p>It’s always sad to see something that took 2 years of your life to disappear like that, especially after I tried to convince the people in charge that they were going head down to destruction.</p>
<p>Anyway, life goes on, and I’m sure there’ll be other occasions for everybody in the team to shine even if in different projects and walks of life.</p>
<p>I want to thank Hannah, Eilidh, Evaldas for spending a painful last year with me (2009) and Tom and Frank for starting the project.</p>
